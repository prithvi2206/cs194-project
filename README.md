#inturn.io

*inturn.io* is a web and mobile solution for college students to manage the various facets of their internship or job recruitment process through a centralized cloud-hosted platform. Centered around an efficient, easy-to-use dashboard, the product allows students to streamline the recruiting process for all their positions, providing tools for managing resumes, cover letters, contacts from networking events, job-related events, and interviews. Furthering its utility, the solution features integrations into various popular tools commonly used to help manage the job recruitment platform, such as Gmail and Google Calendar.

$ cd cs194-project
$ sudo npm install
```

### Usage
To run the node.js server backend, run 
``` sh
$ node server.js
```
from the project home directory.

### Dependencies
The backend of our project is hosted on [Parse] 

<!---
Include some shit about those struggz we faced with using Parse for the backened with having additional node modules. 
-->

The program uses on the following APIs:
  - Google API (Calendar and Mail)
  - Feedzilla API for Dashboard News Feed
  - keep going

A list of the most heavily leveraged Node.js modules used by inturn.io is given below. A complete list can be found in `package.json`.
  - [passport], for google authentication with OAuth2.0.
  - [google-calendar], a minimal wrapper around Google's Calendar API, to form requests more easily.
  - [node-gmail-api], a wrapper around Google's Mail API, to handle batch requests more easily. 
  - keep going

### Data Model Structure and Backend Design

We created tables for *User*, *Application*, *Attachment*, *Contact*, *Document*, *Event*, and *Message*.

##### User
User model. Stores personal information, along with google auth information.
```
objectId     : (String) unique user identifier generated by Parse
username     : (String) the email address corresponding to the Google 
               account the user signed up with.
password     : (String) a hash (hashed by Parse via bcrypt) of the 
               password set during onboarding.
firstName    : (String) set after Google Authentication
lastName     : (String) set after Google Authentication
googleId     : (String) unique ID allocated by Google for authentication
calId        : (String) ID of the "inturn" calendar that the software
               automatically creates upon account creation
googleToken  : (String) Google auth token
refreshToken : (String) refreshToken, used whenever Google needs to 
               refresh the authentication (usually every 15 mins)
passwordSet  : (Boolean) a simple flag to store the state of onboarding
```
